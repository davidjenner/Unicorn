CD to the Unicorn file and then run './unicorn.sh'

The code displays an ASCII art banner, prompts the user to enter a website URL, and checks if the website is online. If the website is online, it proceeds to get information about the server, including the type of server, IP address, location, and software information. It then gets network information and DNS records for the website. Next, it displays information about the DNS registrar, domain name registration date, and WHOIS information. The script also gets SSL/TLS certificate details, page speed and performance metrics.
